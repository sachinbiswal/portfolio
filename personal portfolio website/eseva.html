<p>e-Seva Kendras have been created in the High Courts and in one District Court in each State on a pilot basis. It enables litigants to obtain information with respect to case status and to obtain copies of judgments and orders. These centres also extend assistance in e-filing of cases. These Kendras represent a significant step for the common man and his right to access to justice.</p>
